# GNU-Case-Study
GNU is a project that aims to create a free and open source operating system that respects usersâ€™ freedom and control. It was initiated by Richard Stallman in 1983 as a response to the decline of the software-sharing community and the rise of proprietary software.

Understanding the developmental models:
GNU software typically follows a collaborative and open-source development model. It is often developed by a community of volunteers who contribute to the code. The development process is transparent, with source code available for anyone to view, modify, and redistribute.

Licensing:
GNU software is mostly licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a copyleft license that grants users the four freedoms to run, study, share, and modify the software. The GPL also requires that any modified or derived versions of the software must be released under the same or compatible license terms.

Modes of funding:
GNU software is funded by donations from individuals and organizations, as well as by sales of CDs, manuals, and merchandise. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is the main organization that supports the development and promotion of GNU software. The FSF also provides legal assistance and education for free software users and developers.

Commercial/Non-Commercial uses:
GNU software can be used for any purpose, including commercial and non-commercial uses, without any restrictions. However, if a user or a company distributes or sells copies of GNU software, or incorporates it into other products or services, they must comply with the terms of the GPL and provide the source code and the license to the recipients.
